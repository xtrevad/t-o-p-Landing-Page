                <h1>Birds Which Are Not Magpies </h1>
                <p>Here is a collection of some Australian birds which are definitely not Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen), despite their best efforts to convince you otherwise. Don't be fooled, no matter  what they tell you. Sign up for our mailing list for quarterly updates.</p>

                    <p>The magpie lark. Despite its name, it is neither a magpie or a lark. Smaller than a magpie, it can be found screaming at you or attacking its own reflection. 6/10 copycat.</p>

                    <p>The  pied butcherbird. Despite its beautiful melodious call, it is a ruthless ambush hunter. Can be found perched atop poles and trees, surveying potential victims. 8/10 impersonation.</p>

                <div>

                    <p>The pied currawong. A close relative of both the magpie and the butcherbird, but with piercing yellow eyes which are just <em>begging</em> you to call it a magpie and see what happens. 5/10 magpie resemblance, 9/10 frightening.

                    <p>The superb fairywren. This one isn't even trying. Just look at it. It's basically a fluffy little blue ball with legs. It shouldn't even be on this list, but I'm keeping it in because it is 10/10 adorable.</p>

            <p class="quote-text"> On behalf of all magpies, I'd just like to stress how important it is to be vigilant for impostors. We've worked tirelessly over many years to develop a reputation for stealing shiny things and swooping innocent bystanders and we're sick and tired of other species trying to mooch off our brand. There's only one Australian magpie, and don't you forget it. </p>
